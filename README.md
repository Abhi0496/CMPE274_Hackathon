# CMPE274_Hackathon

&quot;The code starts by setting up the necessary dependencies, including Gradio, OpenAI, and
Llama Index. It then initializes the embedding model and the OpenRouter language model for
querying documents.&quot;

&quot;The documents, including a State of Food Security PDF, Mosaic&#39;s financial report, and a CSV
file, are indexed using Llama Index&#39;s VectorStoreIndex. This index is then used to create a
query engine for answering questions related to food security, malnutrition, and Mosaic&#39;s
influencers.&quot;


&quot;The code then sets up a Gradio dashboard with three tabs: RAG Chatbot, Plot, and Executive
Report.&quot;

&quot;The RAG Chatbot tab allows users to interact with the query engine by asking questions
related to the indexed documents.&quot;

&quot;The Plot tab visualizes data from the CSV file, providing insights into trends and patterns
related to food security.&quot;

&quot;The Executive Report tab presents a comparative analysis of food security measures, climate
change impacts, and political uncertainties affecting Mosaic and the global food security
landscape.&quot;
